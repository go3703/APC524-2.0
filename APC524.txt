STUDYING SOC CONSTRAINTS FOR FUN WITH GIT

@constraint(UC, cStateOfChargeStart,
    SOC[1] == start_charge + (CHARGE[1]*phs_battery_eff - DISCHARGE[1]/phs_battery_eff))
            #All other periods, excluding last period
    @constraint(UC, cStateOfCharge[t in T[T .> 1 .&& T .<=24]],
        SOC[t] == SOC[t-1] + (CHARGE[t]*phs_battery_eff - DISCHARGE[t]/phs_battery_eff))
            #Last time period
    @constraint(UC, cStateOfChargeEnd,
        SOC[24] == start_charge)
It's getting real!
